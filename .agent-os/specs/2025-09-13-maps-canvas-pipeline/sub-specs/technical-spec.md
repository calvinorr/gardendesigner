# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-13-maps-canvas-pipeline/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Google Maps Integration
- Initialize Google Maps JavaScript API with Drawing Manager library
- Configure drawing tools: polygon, rectangle, circle with custom styling
- Implement satellite view as primary map type for property visualization
- Set map center to property coordinates: 54.651427935687735, -5.580687100975887
- Enable responsive zoom controls with appropriate min/max zoom levels

### Area Measurement System
- Integrate Google Maps Geometry Library for precise area calculations
- Support multiple measurement units: square feet, acres, square meters
- Display real-time area updates during drawing operations
- Implement measurement precision appropriate for garden planning (2 decimal places)
- Store measurement metadata with each drawn shape

### Coordinate Transformation Engine
- Build bidirectional coordinate conversion: GPS lat/lng ↔ Canvas pixels
- Implement scale preservation system maintaining aspect ratios
- Create viewport management for canvas zoom and pan operations
- Handle coordinate system offset calculations for accurate positioning
- Support dynamic canvas resizing with coordinate recalculation

### HTML5 Canvas System
- Implement multi-layer canvas architecture with separate contexts
- Create layer management system: create, delete, reorder, toggle visibility
- Build interactive editing tools: select, move, resize, delete shapes
- Implement canvas-native drawing tools for shape refinement
- Support canvas export to various formats (PNG, SVG, JSON data)

### Shape Data Management
- Design JSON schema for shape data persistence including coordinates, measurements, and layer assignments
- Implement shape serialization/deserialization with coordinate preservation
- Create shape validation system ensuring data integrity during import/export
- Build shape history tracking for undo/redo functionality
- Support batch operations for multiple shape management

### UI/UX Specifications
- Create toggle interface for Maps ↔ Canvas view switching
- Implement layer panel with checkbox visibility controls and layer naming
- Design measurement display panel showing area calculations and units
- Build drawing tool palette with clear mode indicators
- Create responsive layout supporting desktop and tablet usage

### Performance Requirements
- Optimize canvas rendering for smooth interaction with 50+ shapes
- Implement efficient redraw algorithms minimizing full canvas repaints
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations and interactions
- Cache coordinate transformations to reduce computational overhead
- Implement progressive loading for large datasets
