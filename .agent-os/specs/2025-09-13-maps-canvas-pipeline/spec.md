# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Maps Canvas Pipeline
> Created: 2025-09-13
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive Maps → Canvas pipeline that allows users to map property areas using Google Maps interactive drawing tools, get precise area measurements, and transfer these mapped areas to an HTML5 Canvas for detailed editing and ongoing management. This creates a seamless workflow from satellite-based mapping to detailed canvas-based garden design.

## User Stories

### Property Mapping and Measurement

As a property owner with a large garden, I want to use Google Maps to draw and measure different areas of my property (borders, paths, grass, shrubs), so that I can get accurate measurements and create a working document for garden planning.

Users can switch to satellite view, use drawing tools to trace property boundaries and different zones, see real-time area calculations in both square feet and acres, and save these measurements for garden planning decisions.

### Canvas Transfer and Editing

As a garden planner, I want to transfer my Google Maps drawings to an editable canvas, so that I can work with precise measurements while having full editing control for detailed garden design.

The system automatically converts GPS coordinates to canvas pixels, maintains accurate scale relationships, preserves all area measurements, and provides interactive editing tools for refining garden layouts.

### Multi-Layer Management

As a garden designer, I want to work with different layers for different garden elements (borders, paths, grass areas, shrubs), so that I can organize complex garden designs and make selective edits without affecting other areas.

Users can create separate layers for different garden elements, toggle layer visibility, make layer-specific edits, and export individual layers or combined layouts.

## Spec Scope

1. **Google Maps Drawing Integration** - Implement Google Maps Drawing Manager with polygon, rectangle, and circle tools
2. **Precise Area Measurement** - Integrate Google Maps Geometry Library for accurate area calculations in multiple units
3. **Coordinate Transformation System** - Build bidirectional GPS lat/lng ↔ Canvas pixel coordinate conversion
4. **Multi-Layer Canvas System** - Create layer-based drawing system with individual layer controls
5. **Shape Data Export/Import** - Implement JSON-based shape data persistence with coordinate preservation

## Out of Scope

- Advanced canvas drawing tools beyond basic shape editing
- Real-time collaboration features
- 3D visualization or elevation mapping
- Integration with external CAD software
- Automatic plant spacing calculations

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Maps Interface** - Users can draw on Google Maps satellite view and see live area measurements
2. **Working Canvas Transfer** - Mapped areas appear correctly scaled and positioned on HTML5 Canvas
3. **Persistent Layer System** - Users can create, edit, and manage multiple garden area layers
