## Overview

Implement Google Maps JavaScript API integration to provide satellite imagery and interactive mapping foundation for the garden management platform. This establishes the core mapping capabilities that all other features will build upon.

## User Stories

### Interactive Property Mapping

As a homeowner with a large garden, I want to see an overhead satellite view of my property on a web-based map, so that I can visualize my entire garden layout and use it as a foundation for planning and management.

The user opens the web application and sees a map centered on their property location with satellite imagery showing their house, lawn areas, flower beds, trees, and other garden features. The map should be interactive with zoom and pan capabilities, allowing detailed examination of different areas of the property.

### Map Navigation and Control

As a user, I want intuitive map controls for zooming and panning, so that I can examine different areas of my garden in detail or view the entire property at once.

The map interface provides standard controls for zooming in/out and panning around the property. Users can smoothly navigate between overview and detailed views, with the map remaining responsive and smooth during interactions.

## Spec Scope

1. **Google Maps API Setup** - Configure Google Maps JavaScript API with proper authentication and initialization
2. **Satellite Map Display** - Display high-resolution satellite imagery of the user's property as the base map layer
3. **Map Controls Integration** - Implement zoom, pan, and other essential map navigation controls
4. **Property Centering** - Center the map on the user's property location with appropriate initial zoom level
5. **Responsive Map Container** - Create a responsive map container that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop/tablet)

## Out of Scope

- Plant markers and overlays (Phase 1 later features)
- Drawing tools for garden zones (Phase 1 later features)
- Route optimization algorithms (Phase 4)
- User authentication system (separate Phase 1 feature)
- Database integration for storing map data (will be added incrementally)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Google Maps Display** - User can view their property on an interactive satellite map in a web browser
2. **Smooth Map Navigation** - User can zoom and pan around the map with responsive performance
3. **Responsive Layout** - Map displays properly on desktop and tablet screen sizes with appropriate styling
