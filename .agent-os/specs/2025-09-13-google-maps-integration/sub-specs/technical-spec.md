# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-13-google-maps-integration/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Google Maps API Configuration**: Set up Google Maps JavaScript API with proper API key and domain restrictions
- **React Component Architecture**: Create reusable Map component using React functional components with hooks
- **Fluent UI Integration**: Style map container and controls using Fluent UI design tokens and components
- **Responsive Design**: Implement CSS Grid/Flexbox layout that adapts map size to desktop and tablet viewports
- **Map Initialization**: Configure map with satellite view, appropriate zoom level (15-18), and centered on property coordinates
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading of Google Maps API and optimize for smooth interactions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures, network issues, and invalid coordinates
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure API key management through environment variables

## External Dependencies

- **Google Maps JavaScript API** - Core mapping functionality and satellite imagery
- **Justification:** Required for high-quality satellite imagery and interactive mapping as specified in product tech stack. Google Maps provides the most reliable satellite data for property visualization and will support future features like drawing tools and route optimization.

## Implementation Approach

- Create dedicated Map component in React with proper lifecycle management
- Use Google Maps React wrapper or direct JavaScript API integration
- Implement map container with fixed height and responsive width
- Configure map options for satellite view with appropriate controls
- Add loading states and error boundaries for robust user experience
