**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

GardenDesigner will be a comprehensive web-based garden management platform focusing on interactive mapping, plant cataloging, task scheduling, and intelligent mowing route optimization for homeowners with large properties (~1 acre).

### Context

The need arose from managing a substantial property with diverse garden areas (lawns, flower beds, shrubs, mature trees) where traditional approaches led to inefficient maintenance routines, forgotten tasks, and lack of centralized garden information. The solution leverages modern web technologies to create a digital garden companion.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Task Management App**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, existing solutions available
   - Cons: No spatial context, no plant-specific features, no mapping integration

2. **Simple Garden Journal**
   - Pros: Easy to build, focuses on record-keeping
   - Cons: No visual mapping, no optimization features, limited scalability

3. **Mobile-First Application**
   - Pros: Always accessible, native device features
   - Cons: Limited screen space for mapping, complex cross-platform development

### Rationale

Key factors in choosing the comprehensive web platform approach:
- **Spatial Context**: Garden management inherently requires spatial visualization
- **Desktop Optimization**: Mapping and planning work best on larger screens
- **Integration Potential**: Web platform allows easy integration with external APIs
- **Unique Value**: Mowing route optimization provides significant differentiation
- **Future Scalability**: Architecture supports advanced features like ML integration

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Addresses real pain points with innovative features
- Leverages proven technologies (React, Node.js, Google Maps)
- Creates defensible competitive advantage with mowing optimization
- Provides platform for future intelligent features

**Negative:**
- Complex initial development compared to simple alternatives
- Dependency on external APIs (Google Maps, plant databases)
- Higher development and maintenance costs than basic solutions

## 2025-09-13: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead

### Decision

Technology stack: Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB database, React frontend with Fluent UI, Google Maps JavaScript API, external plant database integration (Trefle/APIFarmer).

### Context

Need to select technologies that support interactive mapping, real-time data management, modern UI/UX, and integration with external services while maintaining development efficiency.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Ruby on Rails + PostgreSQL**
   - Pros: Rapid development, relational data model
   - Cons: Less optimal for document-based garden data, fewer mapping libraries

2. **Django + PostgreSQL**
   - Pros: Python ecosystem, strong admin interface
   - Cons: Less JavaScript ecosystem integration, heavier for SPA needs

### Rationale

- **Node.js**: JavaScript everywhere, excellent ecosystem for mapping and APIs
- **MongoDB**: Document model fits plant/task data structure naturally
- **React + Fluent UI**: Modern component architecture with professional design system
- **Google Maps API**: Industry standard with comprehensive mapping features

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Unified JavaScript development experience
- Rich ecosystem for mapping and external API integration
- Flexible data modeling for garden entities
- Professional UI components out of the box

**Negative:**
- NoSQL learning curve for traditional developers
- Multiple external API dependencies
